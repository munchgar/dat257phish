I would say that I am a decent programmer who has a basic understanding on how programming works and how to implement
certain ideas. The problem is that I do not have much experience with agile software development and how to efficiently work
in a team.

- What do I want to learn or understand better?
The things I expect to learn is a better understanding in the agile software development process (where I believe SCRUM will be 
one of the things I will learn alot about). Hopefully I will also learn how to work in a team and experience the problems
that come with it. The last thing I can think of is learning how to work with Git. 


Since I have some programming knowledge I believe I have a stable ground in being able to help people.  

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I do not fully understand the agile process of software development but I believe I am a structured person which will help
the team follow a common goal - and therefore hopefully work better as a team. Helping the team work together will most likely
make our work easier. I can also help with programming issues if other people in my team have problems.


I have not worked with SCRUM before.

- What is my contribution towards the team's use of SCRUM?
I discussed with my team regarding SCRUM and how we should implement it. How long our sprints should be. I did not discuss alot 
regarding for example Trello but I gave my approval. I hope to be a good Scrum master and 


- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I sadly missed one of the meetings but besides that I have been present and gave my input on the team's ideas. I also 
made suggestions regarding the idea and improvements on the product.
