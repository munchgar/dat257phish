Alexander Tepic, Week 1


* What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to work in a larger group where each individual has a certain task to complete, as I’m used to working alone doing everything or in smaller groups.
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I don’t know a lot about the method of working in a group like this, but I do believe I have certain programming skills or general ideas that don’t overlap with everyone else, and by being active in the group chat I can maybe help them on their way to solving their problems.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been active in the talks of how to set up the SCRUM-structure, with talks of setting up a Trello board, and having a github repo.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was the one that came up with original idea for what we are going to make, with general ideas of how to go about it.
