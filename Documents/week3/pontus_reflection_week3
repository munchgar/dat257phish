- What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to structure the environmental statistics and understand how this should be implemented in the application. 


- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have tried to recommend some tutorials on JavaFX (on Discord) which I have found very helpful. 
I have described in an overarching way how the JavaFX code works and how to interact with it but I think I will try to go a bit more in depth. Alternatively this could be a good learning
objective to actually divide responsibility. 
 
- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
 With previous experience, and my leadership education it has become somewhat natural for me to take the role of inofficial SCRUM master. I have organized the SCRUM board and attempted, 
 to the best of my abilities, to use SCRUM and exlplain how to break down user stories and how to interact with the SCRUM board. 
 The previous week was a bit too hectic so I was unable to implement SCRUM properly making the SCRUM board rather static. This week, however, there have been a lot of improvements and
 I think with repetition and practice it will go well

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have made much contributions to the structure of the JavaFX application. I have also some experience working with databases and Java connectors. Therefore I implemented a simple DB 
and the abaility to add and read to the DB which is a rather crucial point in being able to store data to see the statistical improvement/deterioration of the user.
I have, as previously mentioned, contributed a lot to maintaining and improving the structure of the meetings and encouraged making a domain model and sequence diagrams before the 
coding gets out of hand. This has become the focus of the next sprint.
