Zakaria Hersi individual reflection for Week 3

-- My contribution
This week we began to better understand what the application will do
and how the "end-product" will look like. And my contribution that
I started to to was to brainstorm on how the Home screen will look like
and what functionality it should have and what information it should
provide for the user. Since we began with a sprint this thursday (17/09/20)
i've not come too far in that task. However during the meeting I also
mentioned of how the project should be structured and we up with
the idea of having a DomainModel where we could see the whole functionality
and how the different modules would cooperate and so on.

--My weaknesses and things I found difficult
Everyone in the group came along with the idea of having a database where the
data would update and provided so that we could automatically update if any data
were changed, and the database we would use was SQllite which i've never worked
with so it was quite hard to grasp the idea of how it would be useful, or even how
the database works. So I began to search online and grasped the basic
knowledge needed to kinda follow what was going on.

--This weeks success
We finally got to start a real sprint and had a very good idea of how the epics and user stories
would look like, and from there on it was to just get the job done (which we are doing now)

--Until next time
Really get going and have a better understanding on how the whole project is going
to look like as an "end-product", as of right now i think we have a good understanding of that
but you could always get better at visualizing the "end-product" and that eveyone has the same
visualization.
