Johan Fridlund Individual Reflection
# Week 3
## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A:I have so far gained a decent amount of experience with Javafx and Github, but am still not very familiar with them. I am now starting to get a good understanding about how you work with Scrum in a team.
B:I want to be at a pont where my experience with these frameworks and such make me more efficient and my working experience more smooth. 
A->B:To achieve this I want to work more with these as well as consult with my project members as often as possible to learn from them.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A:Right now I am trying to be as active in the discord as possible and attend as many meetings as possible to give my opinion and contribute towards the team's effort. I also try to take in as much information as possible and work with Javafx on my freetime to be able to help with that. In addition to that I have been placed incharge of a more specific task in the project to find information about calculation of CO2 from household, travels ect. And how to implement this. We also have set-in-stone dates for meetings. (2 of them)
B:In the future I hope our communication and collaboration keeps up as well as it has been this week.
A->B:To achieve this I will dedicate time towards being in the discord channel and working with the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

A:By working with my team this week to redesign how we use our scrum-board and learning as well as teaching how to make it better. I have created several issues/notes in the Scrub board we have on Github and I have done my best to keep myself informed on how we should use the Scrum board and Scrum in general by reading some of the litterature of it on the course site.
B:I want to continue to actively update the scrum board and come with ideas and create "issues" on the Scrub board which are accepted by the team.
A->B:To achieve this I think the most important thing is consistancy; to work with the team and keep up with changes, our needs, our other ideas and what the current picture of our project looks like.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

A:I have been working together with the team to get the project working for everyone so that we all can clone it and open it to work on it on the future. I have also been doing small work on user stories.
B:I want to take on tasks from the scrum backlog and work on them to get them done towards the next scum-sprint deadline.
A->B:To achieve this I want to do research and keep dedicating time to work on the project.
