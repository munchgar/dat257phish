   discord chat and the github repo and help out with the things I can.

   effective as possible.

   clear for everyone.

- What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
A: I have participated in our meetings and helped form our new SCRUM-board. I have
   also just started the task I've assigned myself to this week.
B: I want to continue clearing our product backlog by both creating concrete tasks and
   then solve/implement said tasks.
A->B: To do this I need to ensure we create tasks that are relevant to the user stories
      and also make sure I have the required knowledge of the project structure and
      relevant libraries to actually implement them.
