Johan Fridlund Individual Reflection
# Week 4
## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A:Right now I feel like I understand JavaFx as well as SCRUM a lot better. 
B:I Want to learn more about APIs and how to implement them in a suitable way.
A->B:To achieve this I want to be active in the implementation of APIs in our project in one way or another.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A:Right now I am doing my best to help when people have probelms and give my opinion in disscusions. 
B:In the future I hope our communication and collaboration keeps up as well as it has been doing so far.
A->B:To achieve this I will dedicate time towards being in the discord channel and working with the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

A:Right now I am using Scrum in the way we have agreed on. I use it actively and encurrage others to do the same. I have helped implement the scrum-board standard that we now use.
B:I want to continue using the scrum-board in a active and good way to make it easier for my partners to see the progress we are doing and to make them "hyped" about using it actively too.
A->B:To achieve this I think the most important thing is consistancy; to work with the team and keep up with changes, our needs, our other ideas and what the current picture of our project looks like.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

A:This Sprint has been very productive. I have managed to create code and pages for calculating CO2 outputs from Airplanes, Cars, and Foods. This needed a lot of research and I am happy I managed to finish all the scrum-backlog tasks in time. Might have overestimated my ability a little, and will try to put less on the scrum-backlog in the future.
B:I want to take on tasks from the scrum backlog and work on them to get them done towards the next scum-sprint deadline.
A->B:To achieve this I want to do research and keep dedicating time to work on the project.
