Zakaria Hersi individual reflection for Week 7

--What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
During this sprint (the sort of end sprint) my contributions was mostly
to end the project and have a good product to demo. And by achieving
that i finished the last task i had which had to do with the DB and
some UI touches.

-- What do I want to learn or understand better?
As mentioned the earlier sprints i'd like to better familiar
myself with how Sqlite really works, and how to get around
the problem of having a connect problem between a the database
and the application.

-- How can i contribute with help to the team or someone, to learn something new?
I offered my help as much as i could and i helped around with little things
which is something i've learnt during this course. I was not as good when
it came to reaching out to the team and aid them with my initiative.
And to become better with that is to continue with me asking if there
is anything i can do and try to be involved in most things and
get a better understanding of the whole scope.

-- What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
This sprint was like the previous one where I tried to maintain the scrum
as it was and try to get it to be more neat and easier to understand
of how the tasks, user stories and epics are distributed. And we succeeded
pretty good as a team but also as an individual.

KPI
-Kpi levels
1) The stress levels (1-5):
                  Beginning = 2
                  Mid = 4
                  End = 3
2) Satisfaction level of this sprint = 3
3. The size of my tasks were "doable" and i succeeded mostly, the only
drawback was with the issue with the DB where i think i really could not
much about it, due to my lack of comfortably around sqlite.
