Johan Fridlund Individual Reflection
# Week 7
## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A:Right now I feel like I understand JavaFx as well as SCRUM a lot better and I have begun to work with towards the database to try and help more and learn more.
B:I want to keep working on different areas to see how they work and continue to learn.
A->B:To do this I will keep in touch with others to see how they have worked and try my best to learn from them and perform in that area as well.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A:We have started communicating better with the discord and it has been really nice. We are doing progress and I have been able to help team members with their tasks to get the sprintweek on right track.
B:In the future I want to keep communicating like before and just have a positive mindset. It always helps to talk to people and see if you can help and be happy to do so.
A->B:To achieve this I will be active in discord and on meetings. And work on different areas to gain more knowledge so I can help more.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

A:Actively selecting which user stories we should work with at the beginning of the sprint and then dividing them up into tasks and making sure everyone has something to do. After finishing something I update the scrumboard accordingly.
B:I want to keep using KPI's.
A->B:Keep up on the meetings to evaluate our kpis in the team.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

A:This sprint we have started getting everything up in the database and onto the statistics page. This require a lot of collaboration with other team members which knows databases better than me. 
B:Towards the end of this project I would love to see a overhaul of the UI and userfriendlyness and finishing everything up.
A->B:To do this we would have to work pretty hard but by working together and communicating I think it can be done

1. How stressed did I feel at the beginning of the sprint: 2
   How stressed dud I feel at the end of the sprint: 3
2. How sattisfied did I feel of the sprint?: 4
