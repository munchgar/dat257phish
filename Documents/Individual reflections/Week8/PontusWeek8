# Week 8
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to sell a product. What aspects should be shown when you have a very limited time-frame. We have a lot of functionality though some of it does not match "look coherent)


## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Discuss what the core-functionality is and why it should take center stage in the presentation

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
This week has been a bit different as we had our presentation so a lot was just fine tuning and adding small key functionality and prepping for the demo.
We still applied the short scrum meeting as we needed to know exactly what functionalities was functional and what should be removed/hidden from the user as
it was not completely implemented. 

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I have disabled non-functional parts (hidden them from the user)
I have added the ability to delete transportactivities (and shown how to implement it in other sections but there was not enough time)
I think I had the most insight in the code and the application as a whole and have much previous experience demonstrating (presenting) so I tok on the role as presenter
during the live demo and I think evertyne was happy with it. 

KPI:s
1 Stress levels Beginning 3, end 1
  This was Demo week. I therefore spent some extra time fine-tuning some things but felt pretty confident we had a decent product and we have been working well
  with SCRUM. After the demo there was no question that we should all feel very proud of what we have accomplished. 
2. How sattisfied did I feel of the sprint?: 4. I am satisfied with how it turned out though not all sections were coherently styled the core functionality was there. 
3. No real tasks but much cleanup probably equivalent to a medium and a small.
