Johan Fridlund Individual Reflection
# Week 8
## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A:I have been involved with several different styles of coding; backend with creating calculations and generall coding, frontend with the UI, and have also tried my hands at working towards the database. I feel like I have learnt a lot about what working in a team is like.
B:I want to learn how it is to work in a agile team in real life where you are not playing the part of scrum master and product owner as well.
A->B:Keep looking for opportunities to work in this field and hope that I will be able to try it on someday.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A:We have started functioning more as a team during the last couple of weeks and have really boosted our communications between each other. This has helped me not only to get help from others, but also to help those in the team which require assistance.
B:I want to keep up this mindset and be open towards team members in the future.
A->B:Keep working agile in other areas and have a communicative mindset in other projects.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

A:Actively selecting which user stories we should work with at the beginning of the sprint and then dividing them up into tasks and making sure everyone has something to do. After finishing something I update the scrumboard accordingly and participate in the evaluation of our KPI's in the team during meetings.
B:I want to keep working with KPI's and experiment to see what works best in what situation in the furure.
A->B:To do this I will keep this course in mind and learn from it. Both from the mistakes and the steps we took forward.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

A:This sprint we really focused on the touchup of the application. To make it user friendly, get everything in the right place, delete things which are not working and rework the UI as well as some parts of the code. It was a team effort and i contributed mostly in the UI part with HedÃ©n, but also in pretty much all the other parts together with everyone.
B:Last sprint, but I hope we keep this engagement, focus, and positive mindset up for future works.
A->B:

KPIs: (dunno if these are supposed to be here, will see with the team) 
1. How stressed did I feel at the beginning of the sprint: 4
   How stressed dud I feel at the end of the sprint: 2
2. How sattisfied did I feel of the sprint?: 5
