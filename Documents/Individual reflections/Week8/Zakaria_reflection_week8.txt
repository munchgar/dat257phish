Zakaria Hersi individual reflection for Week 8

--What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week was presentation week so most of the deliveries was fine
touches where i took my time to check some functionalities and UI
related addition.

-- What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand what criteria there are to present a product very well where
the audience (if they are potential buyers or something else) are going
to be more involved and ask more questions so that if this project
were to be brought up and further developed that we can look back
to the critics and start from there.

-- How can i contribute with help to the team or someone, to learn something new?
Ask around if there were something i could help with and get everyone
involved so that everyone is on the same page.
-- What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
There were not much in this section due to the presentation but we had the
scrum meeting as usual in order to collect some thoughts before the presentation.

KPI
-Kpi levels
1) The stress levels (1-5):
                  Beginning = 1
                  Mid = 2
                  End = 1
2) Satisfaction level of this sprint = 5
3)I was satisfied of how the presentation went and all the positive feedback
and questions we got. The "tasks" i had this week was minimal due to
the fact that we needed to cleanup before the presentation.
