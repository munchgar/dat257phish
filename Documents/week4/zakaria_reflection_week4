Zakaria Hersi individual reflection for Week 4

-- My contribution
During this week i've been working on the Home Screen and implemented the needed functions for it to work, even though
it had some minor bugs, and during the meeting I tried to further understand where the project is projected.

-- My weaknesses and things I found difficult
It has been sorta difficult to use Scenebuilder since it does not want to collaborate with me, i've failed
to pair the application to my IntelliJ but instead i use Scenebuilder as a separate app and open the .fxml files there
During this week I also find it quite confusing of how i exactly did contribute and how I bring good value
to the team and that has to do with the communication within the group but also mine as an individual.

--Until next time
I will further get involved in the meetings (by saying more and be more vocal) and also further get a grip
of javafx. I will also try to learn more about the database we are using by getting more on hand experience.
And also get more of a Scrum oriented understanding of how to work more agile rather than focusing too much
on the project itself and working with how we should work as a team.
