- What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to structure the UI in both a user-freindly and flexible manner. 
The current UI was enough to get the project of the ground but needs some restructuring to better suit the intended functionality.


- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Create a better domain model and clearer functionalities and objectives and ensure that the common goal of the teams development is clear and met.
 
- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have this week pushed much harder for the use of SCRUM meetings, and the assignment of a different SCRUM master. The Sprints user stories have also become clearer and 
the team has begun adding individual user stories to the backlog as they come up. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have pushed for the integration of pull requests into the master branch after they have been reviewed by other team members. 
This is to ensure that as the teams deliverables are met the branches are merged so that there won't be too many conflicts down the line.
