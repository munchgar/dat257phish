Johan Fridlund Individual Reflection
# Week 6
## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A:Right now I feel like I understand JavaFx as well as SCRUM a lot better. Earlier in the project I felt like I wanted to understand APIs more, but as time progresses I feel more and more that the database which we are working with is taking a more and more important role in our program.
B:I want to learn more about how our database works.
A->B:To achieve this I want to invest time into understanding it and implementing some features which have a relation to the database.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A:During the weeks sprint it has become more clear how important communication is and that we can help each other much better as long as we talk to each other.
B:In the future I could be of help to people who want to understand how calculations are done, how dynamic creation of elements are done in our program and more.
A->B:To achieve this I will be active in discord to answer any questions people have as well as reaching out more to others.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

A:Actively selecting which user stories we should work with at the beginning of the sprint and then dividing them up into tasks and making sure everyone has something to do. After finishing something I update the scrumboard accordingly.
B:I want to keep using KPI's as this has been our weakpoint in our team and we started using them late in our project.
A->B:To achieve this I will reach out to others to make sure I am using them correctly and making sure we get something out of using them.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

A:This sprint I have worked together with Zack to create co2 calculations for household. We have researched together as well as helped each other with UI design and calculations. This should mean that all the calculations are done in some regard.
B:Now that all calculations are done to some extent I want to focus on updating them to the database and also acessing information from the database.
A->B:To achieve this I will be in touch with the team to see if we can divide up the work for the next sprint in a fashion that makes all the pieces come together.

KPIs: (dunno if these are supposed to be here, will see with the team) 
1. How stressed did I feel at the beginning of the sprint: 1
   How stressed dud I feel at the end of the sprint: 3
2. How sattisfied did I feel of the sprint?: 2
3. I took on a medium task and finished it; 3p. I also helped Zack with his stuff.
