Meeting with David

Continues to follow the improved SCRUM practices developed during the last sprint.

Don't use DB interface but implement more responsibility in the DBhandler instead of the controllers.


New and improved KPI:s that can now be analyzed over time and are considered more relevant for the teams work structure (see below)
