# Week 6
## What do I want to learn or understand better?

How the different date functions work in Java and SQLite.
Maybe learn to ask a bit more for help when I'm stuck.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have tried to comment as much of the code as amuch as possible and encourage the team members to look at the specific portions of the project which I know some may have trouble with.


## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Continued encouragement of SCRUM meetings to see what people have done and what they are struggling with in order to offer my help. 

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I have continued implementing the ability to add relevant things to the DB. In this sprint I undertook my biggest task yet, adding a transport activity to the Db so that CO2 levels can be tracked for transports
connected to previously added vehicles. 

KPIs:
1. How stressed did I feel at the beginning of the sprint: 2
   How stressed dud I feel at the end of the sprint: 3
2. How sattisfied did I feel of the sprint?: 3
3. I took on a large task which quicly grew a little bit out of hand. I have it under control now but will probably have to sit a bit during the weekend to finish it. 
large task = 5p (probably closer XL but not quite there).
