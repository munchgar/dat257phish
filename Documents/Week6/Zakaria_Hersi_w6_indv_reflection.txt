Zakaria Hersi individual reflection for Week 6

-- My contribution
During this sprint i got to further work with javafx and get a better understanding of how to work with it,
and also get an insight of how the database really works and learn the core basics of the operation
needed to insert and extract data from the DB. I was also very persistent with how we should stay working
agile and really sticking to our SCRUM-board that we constantly are trying to improve. The main focus was
to implement a UI tabs for the household calculation and get different ways to calculate how electrical
usage would be related with CO2 emission.

-- My weaknesses and things I found difficult
I did found it difficult to understand this weeks task. Specifically my share of the "Cake" and i really dont know
how it really happened. During the meeting i had an idea of what should be done but as soon as i got to work
with my tasks i completely didn't know what i would do in order to fit the rest of the teams implementation.


--Kpi levels
1) The stress levels (1-5):
                  Beginning = 3
                  Mid = 2
                  End = 2
2) Satisfaction level of this sprint = 3
3. The size of both of my tasks was relatively correct and i got to get a smoother workflow now since im
more comfortable with the tools we are using (Scenebuilder etc) and i think i'll manage my 4 point.
