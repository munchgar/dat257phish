Pontus Nellgård Individual reflection 
# Week 2 

## What I did: 
I created a Maven dependency project with included support for JavaFX (openjfx). 
I pushed this project to Github with a basic UI interface containing a main window and some interactability to go to a User window with a list of users and their CO2 emissions.
I try to build JavaFX projects using a main window which consists of a borderPane which loads other scenes into its center. 
I encouraged the others to clone the project and it seemed to work for everyone after extending the .gitignore to not interfere with different JDKs. 
I found a good website to use as inspiration for how to categorize the different CO2 emission sources and extended the application to include a window with these categories.
I created some more user stories in our SCRUM board which I had moved to Github Projects tab. 
I encouraged a discussion about the functionality of the environment calculator. 
I created a branch that I pushed to and then merged with the master branch.

## What I enjoyed:
Working with the JavaFX framework.

## What I found difficult:
I still find it a bit difficult to grasp what exact functionality the calculator will have and what limitations it has.
Maven projects seem to sometimes have a bug in which it tries to build a Kotlin project. This is fixed by going to build→ rebuild project. 
The biggest issue is still not being able to meet in person.

## What really worked: 
Github branching and Maven dependencies.

## Next time:
Further, elaborate on the functionality of the calculator and create detailed user stories and begin working with agile sprints.
