# Week 7
## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I asked for help with the date and me and (Adrian?) solved it. 
How to build a more user friendly interface so that it makes sense what the user should do and how to it. 

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I spent some time with another section of the calculator application and discussed a lot with the developer opf the food related items. So now we have a 
decent prototype for organizing emissions coming from multiple sources. 
I have encouraged the other developers to take a look.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?
Continued encouragement of SCRUM meetings to see what people have done and what they are struggling with in order to offer my help. 
I have proposed to start an hour earlier on mondays to really be able to prepare properly for the supervisor meetings. 

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
I have implemented a generalEmissions inw hich all the different categories of emissions can be displayed regardless of where in the DB they are stored. 
I have impleemnted filters, both for categories and dates. 

KPI:s
1 Stress levels Beginning 4, end 3
  Since it is the final actual work week before the demo and there is still not coherent functionality (though on its way) I feel quite stressed though I believe it will be managaeable. 
  I have calmed down a little as I managed to fulfill my undertaken tasks but I am still quite stressed about not having a very coherent application for the demonstration.
2. How sattisfied did I feel of the sprint?: 4. I did my tasks and added some nice additional features to make it easier and more user friendly. 
3. I took on 1 small and 2 medium tasks and finished them.
