## Group documentation

### Week 1
The team has created a Discord server where much discussion has already taken place.

Two ideas have been discussed, a graphical network for distribution of green energy, and an environmental impact calculator. The second one was chosen unanimously as it had a clearer goal and was much easier to visualize the benefit and deliver individual increments that could later be expanded upon (following Minimal viable product, MVP, practices).
A shorter pitch was created and preliminarily accepted by the supervisor during a lecture.

A repository was created on Github and java (and Javafx) were decided as the programming language of choice. 

A social contract was created and agreed upon by all parties after some discussion.

A digital SCRUM board was created on Trello and a short introduction was given into what SCRUM is and how to write and use user stories and how these travel on the board. 


### Week 2
The team has moved the SCRUM board from Trello to the Github Projects tab. This was done since it was easier to keep everything in one place instead of multiple. 

Some basic JavaFX GUIs with Maven has been uploaded to fulfill the "Hello World". It appears to be working for everyone but sometimes the module has to be added in configurations the first time. 

The team has also begun discussing more in detail what features whould be included, how the calculator should work and how to store the data.
- The prefferable idea would be to have a local file since accessing a server database might not work for everyone (different versions of the DB) and remote access might be difficult. 

The next steps during this week is to refine what functionalities should be included and refine user stories. 

### Week 3
A simple database has been setup using SQLite.
  The interface allows to add users to the database
  User information is read from the DB and presented in a tableview

The gitignore now works much better when handling different SDKs.

The statistical research has begun to analyze what user inputs are required and how these should be handled by the program. 
  Thes analysis will begin with water.

The structure of the project has not been great so far. For this reason much of the meeting was spent on organizing the structure. 
  The outcome is that there will be more meetings (shorter ones).
  More cooperation on different tasks.
  A better overall picture of the project model
  Beginnings of creating a domain model
  Several User stories have been added to the SCRUMboard and sub-tasks can now reference the Epis user story.
  Tasks have been more divided and assigned more clearly among the group members.


### Week 4
The team now has a much better grasp of the JavaFX frameworks and have demonstrated that they can work with it on individual tasks (e.g. graphs and login screen)
This has lead to the requirement of future restructuring of the UI as to both be more easily understood by a user and increase lexibility for the developers. This will be
one of the primary objectives of the next sprint. To accomplish this the team has begun to make a better domain model and structure a Database entity relationship diagram.
This means that the current branches should be merged prior to the restructuring which have been scheduled to be done on monday prior to the supervisor meeting.
The requirements necessary for the various functions and statistics pages are beginning to become clearer, but since there is still much to learn the team has decided to begin by implementing dummy data as to not require to much restructuring of the DB as time goes on. 

The team has decided to pursue the project as a "single" user experience where the various user accounts can be switched. This will make it easier to reach an MVP as the goals are clearer from the perspective of one single users interactions instead of multiple on the same interface. 

The SCRUM meetings have become a much more integral part of the sprint and there have been changes of the SCRUM master as to improve the knowledge and experience of the team members. The SCRUM board is much more continously updated and dynamic. The team members have become much more comfortable with adding new user stories on their own to the backlog. 

### Week 5
The team has now reworked the entire SCRUM-board to have a more efficient approach to the agile software development. This included creating more Epics and discussing
during the first SCRUM meeting of the sprint on how to break them down into user stories. We also implemented more technical-notes (tasks) in order to have a better 
overview of what each person should do. We believe this is a great improvement compared to previous sprints where we were a bit uncertain of what to do.

We were told at the start of the week that our energy in the group was not the best. This lead to discussions during the week on how we can improve our energy in the 
group, and we hope to express more energy during the upcoming meetings.

The one bad thing which can be said about the team is that we have not been the best in working together as much as we wanted to in previous weeks which we believe
our new approach to planning might help us with.
