What is now, as of right now i don’t really have a clear vision of how a “Scrum” really works since this is my first time encountering it and I’d like to better understand the different sprints and subparts of “Scrum” so that I have a easier time implementing the work,
and get a feeling of how the process is going.
And in order to understand “Scrum” I’m going to read about it online and try to understand it by asking questions to my group members since some of them have already been working with “Scrum” before.

I can better help my team members by being a bit more active during our discussions. Unfortunately this week some of our group meetings have crashed with my other course where I had labs. Then again this is the first week and nothing significant has yet to be done and I think i have contributed with some stuff and played my part fairly well.

During our choice of project I think it went very well both from the group perspective but also for me as an individual, we all agreed on the idea and we also motivated to why we should pick that one. 

My contribution to the team's use of Scrum has yet to be shown really, since it was all about to create a repo and social contract and so on which did not lead to a lot of work per say, same goes for the deliveries.
