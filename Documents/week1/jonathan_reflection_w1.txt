For the first week we have talked a lot about what our project is going to be. After having decided that we quickly moved on to implementing different structures and chose what tools to use in our group. Personally, I took it upon myself to be the host of the git repository and have because of that set a goal for myself to deepen my knowledge of git so that I am prepared for any issue that might come our way. We have talked a bit about our different roles in the group but so far nothing is set in stone. When it comes to sprints and scrum I think those of us who have never worked agile before, including me, are still trying to wrap our heads around how it works and how to best use it in our group for this project. My goal is that I will have a more complete understanding of how to work agile and what my role in the group is by next week. I am excited to see what the future holds and think that this project is going to be very valuable to learn from.
