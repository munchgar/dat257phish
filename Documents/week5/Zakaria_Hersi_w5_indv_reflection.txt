Zakaria Hersi individual reflection for Week 5

-- My contribution
This week I really got a chance to contribute to the rearranging of the SCRUM-board and
that was something that the whole team really got going. It was a very intense time to
actually reform our way of working to get a much better agile working flow. How to break
epics down to user stories and then into tasks was something I understood better by the
time we did it several times.

-- My weaknesses and things I found difficult
This week was kinda different from the previous weeks. There was not really a thing that
I found difficult in the same essence as before. I got stuck during the implementation
of the database interface but I will manage soon enough, before the sprint deadline I hope.
But this week, HÃ¥kan did commented on our energy level in the group and I think he is right
in the sense of how low the energy level is during the supervise meetings... on the other hand
our group energy is very different when we have our SCRUM meetings and when we have internal
meetings. In those meetings we do share ideas and are in general involved. But we need to step
it up and that includes me.

--Until next time
For the coming sprint I would like to maintain our way of working more agile and keep
the structure of our SCRUM-board as it is. Also get to work with the energy level in our group.
