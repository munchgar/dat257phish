The product backlog should be assigned from the product owner but in this course we have to do that ourselves
In the Sprint backlog the user stories should be broken down into tasks.

Update the social contract
Create a Definition of Done

Act more motivated in the chats (video?) (Ambition levels)

Discuss adding a developer branch (beta release) and merge it with master instead of individual branches to master.

Empty the sprint backlog before a new sprint (Tasks that are not completed should be moved back to the backlog, usually just for a day)

Update and use KPI:s (for the final report)

Update social contract with security (limit to only use text as functionality due to time constraints)
