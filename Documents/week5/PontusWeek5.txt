- What do I want to learn or understand better?
How to use KPIs. This has been a major issue with this project as we have not as of yet used the KPIs we decided upon. 
We have become much better at using user stories, tasks and breaking those down properly. Thereby we have become much more accustomed to using SCRUM principles. 
We have begun using the DoD much more extensively and updated the contract.

- How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
In the tasks I undertook this sprint there was much utilization of the DB, especially using foreign keys to access a multitude of data from different tables and 
combining them in a visual Tableview. I have tried to comment what is happening and psuhed the commits as different sections are "ready" (not properly tested) and encouraged others 
to read and understand how it works.
 
- What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I pushed hard for prioritizing the tasks during this weeks Sprint planning meeting in order to fulfill the objective of having a minimum viable product that actually can 
produce something of value to an end user. 

- What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have implemented a large new section connected to personal vehicles, their emissions and the focus on a singular user (that can be switched) over the previous multi-user interface.
I have implemented a much more sophisticated DB with many connected tables and commented in code how to get access to multiple tables to display joined datasets.
I hve made an entitiy relations diagram for the DB for easy understanding of how the datapoints/tables are connected.
