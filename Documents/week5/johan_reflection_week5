Johan Fridlund Individual Reflection
# Week 5
## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A:Right now I feel like I understand JavaFx as well as SCRUM a lot better. 
B:I Want to learn more about APIs and how to implement them in a suitable way.
A->B:To achieve this I want to be active in the implementation of APIs in our project in one way or another.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A:Right now we are trying to develop our database and together we are coming up with ideas on how it should be built so that it satisfies everyones needs.
B:In the future I want to keep working together with the team to be able to learn things from them but also giving them my take on it all to hopefully bring useful ideas to the table.
A->B:To achieve this I will do my best to be an active persion when it comes to group discussions.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

A:We redesigned the scrum-board and I brough fourth ideas that went into plan that radically changed the look and feel of the board. I believe our rework of the board also made us more eager to use it and scrum in general.
B:I want to get us to start using our KPIs more to get a better idea of our performance.
A->B:To achieve this I will keep pushing the issue and see how soon we can start using them more in a team.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

A:I have contributed by creating a tab for public transport and its conversion of inputs to co2 outputs.
B:I want to get all the calculations done so that we have the base of the program done and can start working on making things better as well as implementing the database more.
A->B:To achieve this I want to keep working on the co2 calculations and keep communicating with the team to see that I design it in the right way so we do not get too much technical depth.
