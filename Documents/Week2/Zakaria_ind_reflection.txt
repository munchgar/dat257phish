Zakaria Hersi individual reflection for Week 2

-- My contribution
This week we basically began to init the javafx GUI and start to visualize the concept of the project using SceneBuilder.
My contribution was mainly on the meeting where we discussed what to do and how to achieve that, just giving my opinions
and trying to get the ideas together.

--My weaknesses and things I found difficult
During the time the project was uploaded in github and everyone was cloning it, I had for some reason problem with getting
it to work. Some methods that were pre-defined did not resolve in my text editor and there were also also other inconveniences
that stood in my way but i managed in the end to resolve that and successfully clone the project and get to know how javafx
works and how to implement the code using scenebuilder to visualize. This is the first time im working with javafx and
I did find it quite difficult to get the hang of it at first but im managing and getting along.

--This weeks success
We finally got the project on GitHub working and now everyone can push and pull. There was a problem with a second created branch
but we solved it.

--Until next time
Get to actually have a plan to stick with and begin to execute. Try to better elaborate on how the functionality of the project
will look like and how we will achieve that.
