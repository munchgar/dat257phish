Johan Fridlund Individual Reflection
# Week 2 
## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A:I have so far gained a decent amount of experience with Scrum as well as Javafx and Github, but am still not very familiar with them. 
B:I want to be at a pont where my experience with these frameworks and such make me more efficient and my working experience more smooth. 
A->B:To achieve this I want to work more with these as well as consult with my project members as often as possible to learn from them.

## how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A:Right now I am trying to be as active in the discord as possible and attend as many meetings as possible to give my opinion and contribute towards the team's effort. I also try to take in as much information as possible and work with Javafx on my freetime to be able to help with that. 
B:In the future I want to attend more meetings. 
A->B:To achieve this I would like for more set-in-stone dates for the meetings so that I can work around those dates to try and attend them.

## What is my contribution towards the team's use of Scrum?

A:By coming up with ideas and created an issue in the Scrub board we have on Github I have done my best to keep myself informed on how we should use the Scrum board and Scrum in general. 
B:I want to continue to come with ideas and create "issues" on the Scrub board which are accepted by the team.
A->B:To achieve this I think the most important thing is consistancy; to work with the team and keep up with changes, our needs, our other ideas and what the current picture of our project looks like.

## What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?

A:I have worked on my own to set up and understand Javafx more and to understand how to use Github outside of project-meetings. This might not be a contribution directly, but I think it will help in the long run to be up to date with how things work so that the general workflow of the team is good. I have also helped team members check that their merges of branches on Github works and that their intellij-projects also work on other computers so that we can work together.
B:I want to work on a more specific feature and be able to really dig into it all and get some work done.
A->B:To achieve this we need to move themes from the backlog to the sprint backlog and assign project-members to each of the ones we have in the current sprint so that everyone know what they are supposed to do.
