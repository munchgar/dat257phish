Group documentation

Week 1
The team has created a Discord server where much discussion has already taken place.

Two ideas have been discussed, a graphical network for distribution of green energy, and an environmental impact calculator. The second one was chosen unanimously as it had a clearer goal and was much easier to visualize the benefit and deliver individual increments that could later be expanded upon (following Minimal viable product, MVP, practices).
A shorter pitch was created and preliminarily accepted by the supervisor during a lecture.

A repository was created on Github and java (and Javafx) were decided as the programming language of choice. 

A social contract was created and agreed upon by all parties after some discussion.

A digital SCRUM board was created on Trello and a short introduction was given into what SCRUM is and how to write and use user stories and how these travel on the board.
